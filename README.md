# Bi--Directional-Sign-Language-Translator
Developed a smart glove using flex sensors and ESP32 for gesture recognition. Our Model detects sign language gestures by measuring the bending angle of flex sensors.  We used ESP32 to process data and transmit translated sign language to the website, And finally, the website converts gestures into GIF-based video formats for better understanding.
